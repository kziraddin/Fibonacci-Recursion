The given code defines a recursive function called Fibrecursion that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers, starting with 0 and 1. 
For example, the first ten numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
In the code, the base case is defined when n is either 1 or 2, in which case the function returns 1. If n is equal to 0, the function returns 0 
because there is no Fibonacci number before the first one (which is 0).
If n is greater than 2, the function calls itself recursively with arguments n-2 and n-1, and returns the sum of the results of these two recursive calls. 
This recursive approach continues until the base case is reached, and the final result is returned.
Note that this recursive implementation is not very efficient for large values of n as it involves recalculating many values multiple times. 
A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming, which would allow the function to avoid redundant calculations.
